//DEPLOYMENT USING AWS SST:

Create a User in IAM AWS username: ai-interview-platform-sst-deploy and "Attach policies directly" with AdministratorAccess box checked

Clicked on username: ai-interview-platform-sst-deploy and on "Security credentials" tab, Click "Create access key",Select "Command Line Interface (CLI)", Click Next → Create access key and secret access key

Installed “AWS CLI v2” from AWS (Windows installer)

Check Powershell: aws --version

Connect to created SST using powershell:  
aws configure
```
It will prompt you for:
```
AWS Access Key ID:     → paste your Access Key ID
AWS Secret Access Key: → paste your Secret Access Key
Default region name:   → e.g. us-east-1
Default output format: → just press Enter (json is fine)

This saves my credentials to ~/.aws/credentials so SST and the AWS CLI can use them automatically.

Verify it works: aws sts get-caller-identity

On Project folder, install SST using these commands: npx sst@latest init
                                                     npm install

Find the "sst.config.ts" file in your project root. It was just created by SST. And update the config file to instruct SST about our app

Then Deploy to AWS using this command: npx sst deploy --stage production
